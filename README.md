# Installation
EzPort will automatically redirect you to the **EzPort installation page** (if you haven't already installed it).

# Configuration
After you've installed EzPort, it'll create a config.php file in which you can alter the settings. (e.x. change the text colour). If you want to use the easy installer to reconfigure, download and place the install.php file in the main directory.
